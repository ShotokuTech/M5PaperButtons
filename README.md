Note: I used this dark screen background on the M5Paper for the video. But I find this is not as good at detecting touch as the lighter background. This was especially true in bright lights I use for filming.  So I switched it back in the code on my Github site. M5Stack also cautions on exposing the M5Paper to too much UV light.
